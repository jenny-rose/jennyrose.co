Hullo there! My name is Jenny Rose (middle name, FYI), I'm 27, and I'm an obsessive autodidact. I'm constantly marinating in literature, notebooks, and tea. I'm a web development student at Hennepin Technical College, switching gears after studying photography at Columbus College of Art and Design for four years.[^1] 

I was born in Fort Knox, Kentucky, spent the first seven years of my life in Germany, did the rest of my growing up in Ohio, and now live in the Twin Cities area with my boyfriend, five computers, and three consoles[^2]. We're compensating for the lack of fur babies in my life.

[^1]: I don't recommend art school. It's expensive, and I didn't learn anything that I couldn't have learned on my own. Still, it was an interesting experience!
[^2]: 27" iMac, 13" Macbook Pro (my machines), a custom Windows machine, two work laptops (his, both Macbook Pros), Wii U, X-box 360, and PS3. None of them have names, but they probably should.
